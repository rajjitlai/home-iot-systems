# PID Line Follower Robot using Arduino Nano

This project demonstrates a 2WD PID-controlled line follower robot built using an Arduino Nano, TB6612FNG motor driver, 7-channel IR sensor array, and standard DC motors. The robot is capable of detecting and following black lines on various types of tracks using PID control for smooth turns and accuracy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Setup

The robot is powered by a 7.4V battery connected in two branches:

1. One branch powers the TB6612FNG motor driver‚Äôs VM pin directly (motor power).
2. The second branch is passed through an LM2596 buck converter to supply 5V regulated power to:
   - Arduino Nano (via 5V pin)
   - TB6612FNG VCC (logic power)
   - IR Sensor Array (5V and GND)

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not use the VIN pin when using a buck converter for 5V. Connect 5V directly to the Nano‚Äôs 5V pin.

## üí° Features

- Uses PID algorithm to follow black lines precisely.
- Supports variable track conditions and curves.
- Modular power supply (can use AA batteries for testing or 7.4V Li-ion/LiPo for performance).
- Easily adaptable to digital or analog IR sensor arrays.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Assemble the components and complete wiring as described.
2. Upload the PID control Arduino sketch (pid_line_follower.ino) to your Arduino Nano.
3. Place the robot on a black line track.
4. Power the robot and observe line following behavior.
5. Tune the PID values in the code for optimal performance based on your track.

## üìù PID Tuning Tips

- Increase Kp until the robot follows but overshoots/oscillates.
- Add Kd to reduce oscillations and sharpen turns.
- Add Ki only if there's a consistent drift over time.

Example values:

```cpp
float Kp = 25;
float Ki = 0;
float Kd = 15;
```

## üß™ Testing Option

You can temporarily use 4x 1.2V AA NiMH rechargeable batteries (4.8V total) for slow-speed testing. Connect this directly to the Arduino Nano's 5V pin and to TB6612 VCC. Do not use the VIN pin in this case. The motors may run slower, but it's safe for sensor and logic testing.
