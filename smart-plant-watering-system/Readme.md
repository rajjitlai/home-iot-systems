# üå± Arduino Soil Moisture Pump Control System

This project uses a soil moisture sensor to monitor the moisture level of soil and automatically turns a water pump **ON** or **OFF** based on the dryness of the soil. It is a simple, cost-effective, and beginner-friendly automatic irrigation system.

## üöÄ How It Works

- The soil moisture sensor outputs `HIGH` when the soil is **wet**.
- It outputs `LOW` when the soil is **dry**.
- The Arduino reads this signal on digital pin D6.
- If the soil is dry (`LOW`), it turns ON the pump (sets D3 `HIGH`).
- If the soil is wet (`HIGH`), it turns OFF the pump (sets D3 `LOW`).
- Status messages are printed via Serial Monitor every second.
