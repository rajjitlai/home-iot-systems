# üöó PID Line Follower Robot (Black Line on White Background)

This project implements a **PID-based line follower robot** using an **Arduino UNO**, **TCRT5000L 5-channel IR sensor**, and **TB6612FNG motor driver**. The robot is designed to follow a **black line on a white surface**, handling both straight paths and U-turns smoothly and efficiently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Power Supply

You can use one of the following:
- **7.4V Li-ion Battery Pack**
- **5x AA 1.5V cells = 7.5V**

**Important:** Connect all GNDs together (Arduino, battery, motor driver).

## üß† How It Works

- The TCRT5000L IR sensor array detects a black line on a white surface.
- Sensor readings are weighted and passed into a **PID controller** which calculates a positional error.
- Based on the PID output, motor speeds are dynamically adjusted using PWM to steer the robot.
- When the line is lost (e.g., during a U-turn), the robot uses the last known direction to recover and re-center itself.

---

## üíª Software Overview

- Developed using **Arduino IDE**
- Uses **digital sensor inputs** (LOW = black, HIGH = white)
- PID values (`Kp`, `Ki`, `Kd`) are configurable for tuning
- Serial Monitor is used for debugging sensor readings and behavior

---

## üß™ Expected Behavior

- Smooth tracking of black lines
- Stable turns and U-turns
- Real-time correction using PID
- Auto-recovery when the line is lost
